hospitality and Smart city

->for those hotels investing in digital apps for check-ins and room services this app would endorse features like

     *Room recommendations on the basis of the user preferences or past purchases

     *providing information such as surrounding entertainment venues ,local newspapers/magazines ,medical facilities and similar services

     *Instead of hanging a 'Do not disturb' sign on doors or having cleaning staff wake up travelling guest with  knocks hotels can use an innovative approach by using infrared scanners that will detect body heat within a room & tell cleaning staff through app that they come back rather later if the room is currently occupied

    *Smart room keys whereby a barcode  generated dynamically by the app would be used for unlocking the door instead of guests having to worry about picking up keys and front desk staff wont have to issue new keys in the event that the guest loses their room key

   *Light and air conditioning control through app

  *taking food orders through app rather than guests having to roam in the lobby doing so.
